# WYB - What You Breathe

## How To Use

This app is nothing different from a billion others you've already used. 
<br>Type a keyword in the search bar to find a specific location and hit "üîé". 
<br>Hit "üìç" instead to input your current location. That's about it.

## How To Run

Download the repo and run "npm run build" to see it in action
<br>(in order to function correctly, you'll have to set your own api key in the ".env_sample" file).
